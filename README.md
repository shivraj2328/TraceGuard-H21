## 📌 Problem Statement

Modern applications — especially microservice-based systems — generate a flood of logs and system events. When something breaks, developers end up hunting across services, files, terminals, and code paths just to find the source of the problem.

**In short:**
- 🔍 `grep -R "error"` doesn't scale as projects grow
- 🧩 App errors are hard to correlate with system issues (CPU, memory, disk, network, DNS)
- 🗂️ Logs live in silos across services, with no single source of truth
- ⏱️ Debugging becomes slow, manual, and reactive instead of proactive

**TraceGuard** solves this by building a centralized monitoring and log management platform — collecting logs, errors, metrics, and system events into one dashboard where developers can search, analyze, and act.

## 🚀 What We're Building

A unified observability platform for **applications** and **Linux-based infrastructure**, built from these components:

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| 🖥️ Linux/System Monitoring Agent | Collects CPU, memory, disk, process, and network data |
| 📦 Technology-specific SDKs | Drop-in libraries for apps to report errors/events |
| 🌐 Event Collector REST API | Ingests events from agents and SDKs |
| ⚙️ Event Processing Engine | Parses, validates, filters, and categorizes events |
| 📬 Event Queue | Buffers events for async, reliable processing |
| 🗄️ Centralized MongoDB Storage | Stores logs, metrics, traces, and system events |
| 📊 Dashboard + REST API | Search, visualize, and monitor everything in one place |
| 🔔 Alerting & Notifications | Flags critical issues in real time |

## ✨ Core Features

### 1. 🐞 Application Error Monitoring
Captures errors, warnings, fatal exceptions, stack traces, API/request failures, and performance events — each enriched with timestamp, service, environment, and request context.

### 2. 🐧 Linux System Monitoring
A lightweight agent tracks CPU, memory, disk, running processes, network stats, and system-level events — so app issues can be viewed alongside infrastructure health.

### 3. 🌐 Network & Infrastructure Monitoring
Detects connectivity failures, DNS resolution issues, port/connection problems, and service availability gaps.

### 4. 🕵️ Suspicious Activity Detection
Flags unusual behavior — unexpected processes, abnormal network activity, repeated failed requests, and resource spikes. *(Initial focus: detection & logging, not a full SIEM.)*

### 5. 🗂️ Centralized Log Management
All logs, errors, metrics, traces, and system/network events land in one categorized, searchable place — no more hopping between services.

### 6. ⚙️ Event Processing
A dedicated pipeline parses, validates, filters, categorizes, and flags incoming events before storage.

### 7. 📊 Monitoring Dashboard
Log & error search, live monitoring, system stats, analytics, alerts, and service-level views — all from a single UI.

### 8. 🔔 Alerts & Notifications
Critical events trigger notifications via Webhooks, Email, Slack, and more — so nobody has to babysit the dashboard.

## ⚡ Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/KurukShetra-Core/TraceGuard.git
cd TraceGuard

# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install        # or pip install -r requirements.txt
